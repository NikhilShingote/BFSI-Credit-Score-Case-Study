# BFSI-Credit-Score-Case-Study

Project Discription

SmartLend is a financial institution that understands credit risk is inherent in banking. As you understood just now, credit risk simply refers to the possibility that payments may be made late or not at all, which may result in cash flow issues and may impact a bank’s liquidity. Despite advancements in the financial services industry, credit risk continues to be the key factor in bank failures. In most cases, this part of risk management accounts for more than 70% of a bank’s balance sheet. Therefore, it is imperative for any financial institution to determine customers’ credit scores and SmartLend is no exception.

 

The primary objective of this project is thus helping SmartLend to divide its customers into different credit score brackets based on their demographic and past transactions data.

1. SmartLend would like to better understand the primary factors that contribute to a person's credit score based on their demographics and past transactions data.
2. Using historical information, it wants to be able to predict which credit bucket a customer would fall into.
3. SmartLend wants to use this information to make lending decisions more robust and accurate thereby decreasing their credit risk.
4. How do various demographic and transaction features affect a person's credit score?
5. Based on the historical data, can you predict the factors that generally lead to a poor credit score? Identification of these customers is imperative to reduce credit risk.
6. On identification of these factors, how can you create a lending process that ensures that the institution is only lending money to customers with a relatively good credit score? 
7. Can you draw any business insights based on your developed model?
